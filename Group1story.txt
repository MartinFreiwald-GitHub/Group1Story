Once upon a time, five people gathered together to write a story. Many dangers lay ahead of them.
They were the last five in the computer lab. Out of the dark recesses beneath the computers, warrior hamsters emerged and surrounded them.
The hamsters were big and buff, but the five stood boldy against their new foes... 
One of hamsters needed help finding a computer almanac on either great progammers or developers of the 21 century.
